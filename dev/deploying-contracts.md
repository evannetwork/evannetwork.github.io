# Deploying Contracts

If you are new to evan.network, no matter if you are also completely new to ethereum contract development, or if you already have a portfolio of contracts you want to deploy, you will want to put them on
the network rather sooner than later.

We have a small example on how to do this with truffle in the [Hello Contract](hello-contract), but this
is actually not the recommended way of doing things. Particularly because it avoids using [DBCP](dbcp), and with it one of the main advantages of evan.network.

So here we go:

# Compiling
Contracts are written in [solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/). Nothing else is supported.
You can write and compile and test your contracts on your private test blockchains however you like. Maybe use
truffle, as described in the Hello Contract, or [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org).
