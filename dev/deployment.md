# Deployment

Deploying DApps and smart-contract means publishing the various components using a valid ENS path.
This instruction assumes, that you are used the [evan.network project
generator](https://github.com/evannetwork/generator-evan) for generating your project. This project
structure supports all nesecarry scripts and commands to deploy your projects.

## Build and deploy smart-contracts

After your smart-contracts were build and published within the evan.network blockchain, a compiled
json abi file was generated. This can be referenced within your DBCP description files and acts as a
self described contract.

## ENS DApp deployment

Each DApp can be deployed to the evan.network, so it can be accessed from anywhere, not only from a
localhost server. This is handle by an wrapped library, to handle the deployment as simple as
possible. To deploy DApps to ens paths, you need one configuration file, that specifies which
accounts and which configurations should be used for the deployment. This file must be js / json
files that exports specific values [deployment config](https://github.com/evannetwork/generator-
evan/blob/develop/generators/app/templates/config/deployment.js).

Simply open your evan-network base project. Within your config folder, a deployment.js file is
included, that contains all the important configurations for your deployment. Here you must insert
your accountID and your private key, so the script can handle ENS description deployments for you.

**Currently: For security reasons, the ownership of the ENS addresses are reserved for the members
of the evan GmbH.**

To register a ENS address, contact the evan.network team [here](https://gitter.im/evannetwork) and
send us your desired ens subdomain and your accountId. (**No one of the evan.network team will ask
you for your data or private key! Never send your private data to others!**). Mostly, the
evan.network team will reserve you a sub domain, so you can manage your addresses behind, by
yourself. Don't forget to prefix the name of your DApp with the subdomain that were assigned to you
(e.g. myapp.mysubdomain). When you changed the name within the dbcp.json, don't forget to update the
index.ts file of your DApp, else your application can cause an endless loop. Their you will find the
following code:

```
return buildModuleRoutes(
  `myapp.${ getDomainName() }`,
```

Change it to: 

```
return buildModuleRoutes(
  `myapp.mysubdomain.${ getDomainName() }`,
```

You can run the following script to choose wich projects you want to deploy.

```bash
npm run deploy pathToConfig
```

**Be sure that "pathToConfig" is the absolute path to your deployment configuration (e.g. /path-to-my-project/config/deployment.js)!**

Each DApp that were successfully build by "npm run dapps-build", is available by to your deploy
scope.

So, when you deploy anything, it will be available under the following ENS domain:

```
dappname.subdomain.evan
```

Now, you can open the ens address to your application on https://dashboard.test.evan.network#/my-ens-address.evan. (my-ens-address = dbcp.name)
([3.3 View it in the Real World](/dapps/standalone/standalone))

## IPFS Deployment

If you want to deploy your application without any ENS address by using an contract, you can have a
look at the [standalone DApp tutorial](/dapps/standalone/standalone) in the section "3.1 Deploy Æ‰App within an Contract".
