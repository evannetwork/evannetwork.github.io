# ENS to DNS

Gives you the possibility to reach every [ENS](/dev/ens) name to via DNS through the web.

If you have registered a ENS name e.g. `4711.digitaltwin.mydomain.evan` and you have provided a [DBCP](/dev/dbcp) spec with a working DAPP, than you can access this DAPP in the Browser via `https://4711.digitaltwin.mydomain.evan`

The ENS2DNS service is in test currently.
