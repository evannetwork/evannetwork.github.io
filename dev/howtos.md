If you just want to do quick tests, it is best to just use the [blockchain core console](/dev/bccc)

# Deploy Contract

# Call Readonly Contract Methods

# Execute Transactions

# Deploy Public Documents

Public documents are just Documents stored in the distributed file system, accessible by anyone,
and the hashes of those Documents are used in a DBCP file or a contract somewhere.

# Deploy Private Documents: Envelopes

Since the data in distributed file systems is accessible to anyone, the only way to have private data is to encrypt the data. In the standard evan.network data contracts, the links/hashes to the documents that are stored in them are also encrypted, to prevent external data miners from connecting specific datasets with specific contracts.

All this is handled automatically by the blockchain core library with envelopes.
