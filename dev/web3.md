# Web3

Web3 is a Ethereum collection of API modules to interact with a remote Ethereum node and so directly with the evan.network.
You can find a detailed API documentation at [https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html)<sup>[+]</sup>

You can create a web3 instance and perform your calls against evan.network via HTTPS and WebSocket provider.

Contract calls can of course be executed in the same way.

Though this possible way to interact with the network, it is recommended to rely on the API framework, as it acts as an abstraction layer for interacting with the evan network and makes complex operations more easier.
