# Getting started

evan.network offers developers a wide range of features, services, blueprints and best practices to make the developers live easier.

To start hacking on evan.network it is the best to use the [testcore](/docs/urls) network to make the first steps. The [testcore](/docs/urls) network is similar to the [core](/docs/urls) main network but without the need to buy [EVE](/docs/eve) tokens. To get EVE tokens for the [testcore](/docs/urls) network you can join the [Gitter faucet](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/faucet) channel and post you account id.
