# Getting started

evan.network offers developers a wide range of features, services, blueprints and best practices to create incredible decentralized applications.

The evan.network is a [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) based blockchain and you can use any Ethereum/EVM compatible toolset. There are many good Wikis and Howtos available to learn more about the Ethereum technology. A good starting point is the official [Ethereum Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki).
The evan.network can be used for plain Ethereum Smart Contract development with the [Web3](/dev/web3) API, but we offer much more things to create real decentralized applications. Ethereum itself is the Blockchain to work with SmartContract and to create decentralized trust between different parties. But the Blockchain itself isn't made for storing assets like documents, data and applications. For that reason we are offering an integrated IPFS storage that is used to store non Blockchain data and to deliver DAPPs. You can read more about our [IPFS](/dev/ipfs) to get an better understanding why it is so important and how you can use it in your applications.

## Development Chain

To start hacking on evan.network it is the best to use the [testcore](/docs/urls) network to make the first steps. The [testcore](/docs/urls) network is similar to the [core](/docs/urls) main network but without the need to buy [EVE](/docs/eve) tokens. To get EVE tokens for the [testcore](/docs/urls) network you can join the [Gitter faucet](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/faucet) channel and post you account id.
