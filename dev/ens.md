# ENS

ENS is the [Ethereum Name Service](https://github.com/ethereum/ens)<sup>[+]</sup> adapted to the need of evan.network. Normally a contract has a 32bit hex id e.g. `0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d`, the work with such id's is for an user really hard, especially if you system is based on DAPPs where everything is a contract.

The ENS allows developers to give real/speaking names to contract id's like DNS does for IP Adresses in the Web.

The top level domain (TLD) for every name you can register is fixed to `.evan`

You can register custom ENS domainnames for your company or application and can register custom subdomains below your domain. We offer a ENS DAPP to register custom domains later, in the meantime you can contact the developer on [Gitter ENS](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/ens)<sup>[+]</sup>.

**NOTE:** All names you have registered in the public Ethereum Blockchain are not available in evan.network.
