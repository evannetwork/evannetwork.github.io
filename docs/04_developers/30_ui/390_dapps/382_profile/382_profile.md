# Profile DApp

The profile DApp shows the current logged in user, its evan.network alias and its account id. Within
this DApp, the user can export it's private and encryption data key, for usage within other tools
like Metamask.

** Be careful with that! Exporting and locally storing this data enables data leaks, so you could be hacked! **

Furthermore, this DApp enables local runtime configurations.

- View your profile status and manage private and profile keys.
