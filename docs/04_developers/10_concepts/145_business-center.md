# Business Center
Business Centers are communities for working together on specific topics. They group together accounts and contracts and set a context for the work on the contracts. These contexts may be companies, projects or common interests.

Depending on the setup of the business center users may
- join on their own
- be invited to join
- be added by anyone that is already a member

Users may join as many Business Centers they like and they all are independent working spaces with their own scope and data. Their [√êAPPs](/docs/04_developers/basics.html) are similar to dashboards and members can start working on contracts in the current business center or create new contracts in it.

Accounts can create a Business Center scoped profile, which is similar to a business card for that context. In it users may provide data for other members to find them and start working together or share their qualifications or certificates with the Business Center community.
