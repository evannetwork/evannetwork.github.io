# Smart Contract Security and Permissioning (SCEP)

## About Smart Contract Security
Smart contracts are pivotal to everything happening on evan. Almost every feature on the platform utilizes smart contracts in one way or the other. Naturally, security surrounding smart contracts is a top priority on the evan.network.

Since evan.network is an open ecosystem involving many participants, permissions at times have to be given trans organizational (allowing externals to access internal company data), adding yet another level of complexity.

With that in mind the Smart Contract Permissioning (SCEP) is built around certain main concepts:
- prevent malicious contract manipulation
- prevent contract content from being illegally accessed by third parties
- granularly define access and role definitions

In terms of usability, this mechanism is furthermore designed to make interaction with smart contracts not only secure, but also as swift as possible.

Usually, parties wishing to engage each other on the evan.network have to exchange their keys first, which is a manual process. This is done via Diffie-Hellman and the purpose of these exchanged keys is the communication between both parties. The keys exchanged this way are then used for communication between them and for sharing additional encryption keys for smart contracts.

By delegating permissions no human interaction is required, as users don't have to manually exchange keys with the owner of the respective smart contract to receive access.


## Introducing Smart Contract Permissioning

### Introduction to Smart Contract Permissioning
Granular permissioning for smart contracts is facilitated through the Smart Contract Permissioning.

To facilitate access control, each smart contract can be thought of as holding the keys for users that are supposed to interact with the contract. This key store is referred to as the 'sharings' section.
Authorization and access level for each user is configured by the contract owner and reflected in the participant's key.

Now, if a permissioned user writes changes to the smart contract, a participant authenticates himself to the contract and the key required to perform this operation is retrieved from the sharings section of the contract.
Through this mechanism it is made possible to ensure at a granular level that only ever intended users gain access to exactly what they are supposed to see and restrict access to content that is off limits.


### Details Permissioning
As the main part of data related to contracts is stored in the distributed file system, only references to the DFS are stored in the contract. Contents in the DFS are encrypted with one or more keys specific to the contract instance they belong to.

Contract participants, which should be enabled to read and/ or write contract content, need to have access to the keys responsible for the contract data (called 'data keys' in this context). This is done by maintaing a 'sharings' info, which is basically a key store keeping data keys, grouped by the following criteria:
- **participant** - the contract participant, the key is intended for
- **section** - the section in the contract, which holds encrypted data
- **block** - this annotes the _starting_ point, from which on the key is valid

The Sharings of a contract is basically a structured list of encrypted keys.

In a simple contract, the creator of the contract creates a single data key for this contract and wants to share it with other contract members to enable them to read the data in the contract. Therefore, the creator puts the data key into the Sharings info. To prevent third parties from accessing this data key, it is encrypted with the communication key between the contract owner and the contract participant.

![sharings - schema](/public/dev/sharings_schema.png)

For **Data Contracts**, the owner creates a data contract and a rights and roles contract. Next, they are linked together.
The contract owner then defines which groups, or users, are allowed to make edits to fields on the Data Contract.
Access can be given granularly to entry,list and mapping contract values.

## Establishing trust with Participants
# Key Exchange
By default, any data stored in [Smart Contracts](/dev/smart-contracts) is encrypted. This is also true for [profiles](/tutorial/create-identity), [Digital Twins](/dev/dgitial-twin) and other tools. As a result, it is impossible for others to read data in external contracts. Profiles can't read each others contacts etc. People can't even send each other [BMail](/tutorial/mailbox) messages.

To establish communication, accounts/ contracts need to exchange keys. This is one of the most basic operations in `evan.network`, because without exchanging keys, little else can be done. If you are an end user, it is done for you in most cases and you won't even notice. Otherwise, you can use the [contacts](/tutorial/contacts) √êApp to initiate key exchanges.

As a developer, you usually have to keep track of this yourself, unless you use one of the helper functions from [Factories](/dev/smart-contract#contract-factories) or [Business Centers](/dev/smart-contract#business-cener).

The key exchange module is made available through the [blockchain core](https://github.com/evannetwork/api-blockchain-core) library.


### Key Criteria
#### Data Keys
The creator of a contract creates a data key on contract creation and adds this to the Sharings as 'shared with herself/ himself'. This key is not stored on the owners side and the owner performs exactly the same steps to retrieve the data key as all contract participants.

#### Participants
There is no catch-all keyword for sharing encrypted contents with everyone, or a similar mechanic. Sharing happens explicitely and directed from the owner to a participant.

When sharing keys with contract participants, the data key is encrypted with the communication key ('comKey') between the party sharing the key and the party the key is shared with. This means that before sharing encrypted contract contents with another party, usually a key exchange needs to be undertaken beforehand.

To expose encrypted content to a broader scope without performing a key exchange beforehand, keys can be shared via a scope. This scope has to be known by all participating parties and the key that belongs to the scope has to be accessable by all participating parties. An example for a scope can be a common business context - like a Business Center, where all participating parties cooperate in.

#### Sections
Typical examples for Sections are lists and properties in DataContracts. Each participant gets an entry in the Sharings with the section names that are shared with him or her.
Other contracts like Asset Contracts or Service Contracts hold data in applicable properties, to which can be referred in the same manner.

If all contents of a contract are encrypted with the same key, this key can be shared for the section '*', which means all sections. Key retrievals get the section names as an argument and for keys in this manner:

1. Check if a section with the same name as requested has been added to the participant's key section - if one exists, use keys from it
2. If no matching section was found, check if this participant has keys for the all section '*' - if so, use keys from it

#### Blocks
##### Key Lifetimes
Blocks in Sharings signal the starting point, from where on this key is valid. So to be able to read data added at a specific block, a participant requires a key shared before or at the same block.
Data added **after** this block can be read by the participant the data has been shared with. Data added **before** this block cannot be read by this participant through this key.

![multikeys](/public/dev/multikeys.png)

Keys are valid until they are replaced by a new one, which is then valid until replaced or indefinitely removed.

![multikeys - lifetime](/public/dev/multikeys_lifetime.png)

This principle is for example used for retrieving keys to decrypt data from lists, where keys might have been updated over time. Taking the example from the last picture, an entry added at block 37 has to be encrypted with the block 20 key. Elements added in or after block 40 use the block 40 key for en- and decryption.

This ensures that:
- keys can be updated
- old entries stay visible for participants that have been granted access to the old key
- newer entries can only be read by participants that have the current key


##### Zero and Infinity
**Granting** a key starting from block 0 makes this key ultimatively valid, as any data has been added after block 0. This is used for adding a generic key during contract creation.

**Requesting** a key from block 'infinity' by omitting the block argument returns the latest valid key. This can be used when encrypting new data. The timestamp when retrieving this key has to be added to the `cryptoInfo` to ensure that the data can be decrypted later-on.


##### Sharing Keys
When sharing keys with another user, the same block number should be used as the original key. So if user A has a key that is valid starting from block 30 and shares it with user B, the sharing should be made as 'starting from block 30'. This means that user B can read entries added at or after block 30.
If user B gets the key shared as 'starting from 50' for example, this user would not be able to read contents added before this block (even if the key might match the content).




## Deep Dive Permissions in Smart Contracts
### Basic Permissions
Basic permission checks in Smart Contracts verify that the calling user is the owner of the contract. For this approach, the contract inherits from a contract like the owned in ```Core.sol```:
```solidity
contract Owned {
    address public owner;

    function Owned() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) only_owner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    // This only allows the owner to perform function
    modifier only_owner {
      assert(msg.sender == owner);
      _;
    }
}
```
Contract transactions that should only be used by the contract owner use the ```only_owner``` modifier, for example:
```
contract OwnedStorage is Owned {
    string public data;

    function setData(string newData) public only_owner {
        data = newData;
    }
}
```
can have its storage only be set by the owner.

The ```Owned``` contract provides sufficiant permissions for easy contracts or contracts with only one contributor and many consumers, but fails to support different contract structures with different roles.


### Function Permissions
The [Dappsys collection](https://dapp.tools/dappsys/) from [DappHub](https://dapphub.com/) is a bundle of contracts, which solve different common problems contract developers may encounter. Two of those contracts are the [DSAuth](https://dapp.tools/dappsys/ds-auth.html) and the [DSRoles](https://dapp.tools/dappsys/ds-roles.html) contracts, which are used to control contract function access.

If a contract has a function that only a specific scope of users are allowed to use, the contract has to inherit from ```DSAuth```. This adds the ```authority``` property to the contract and allows to use the ```auth``` modifier.

An ```authority``` is a contract that inherits from ```DSAuth```. To use roles for contract permissions, the authority can be an instance of ```DSRoles```. Using this in the previous example, the contract looks like this:

```solidity
contract OwnedStorage is DSAuth {
    string public data;

    function setData(string newData) public auth {
        data = newData;
    }
}
```

The `auth` modifier is used on functions that should be restricted to specific roles and forbids access to them, if the calling account does not meet the permission requirements.

[![Smart Contract authority](/public/dev/smart_contract_authority.png){:max-width="50%"}](/public/dev/smart_contract_authority.png)

This basically forbids almost everyone from using the ```setData``` function, except:
- the contract itself
- the owner of the authority contract
- (if registered) root users
- (if registered) public capabilities (functions can be made public accessible for everyone if required)

Permissions can be granted by:
1. creating a roles contract for the contract and assign it as the authority
2. assigning an account ID to a role
3. granting this role permission (capabilitiy) to a function

```solidity
// sample contract
DSAuth storage = new OwnedStorage();

// create a roles contract for the contract and assign it as the authority
DSRoles roles = new DSRoles();
storage.setAuthority(roles);

// assign an account id to a role (role 0 is an owner like role in this example)
roles.setUserRole(msg.sender, 0, true);

// grant this role permission (capabilitiy) to a function
roles.setRoleCapability(0, storage, bytes4(keccak256("setData(string)")), true);
```

Passing ```false``` as the last argument revoking permissions.

Authorities are usually set up to be their own authorities, which means that groups (and their members) can be granted permissions to maintain capabilities in the same way.

See [DSRoles documentation](https://dapp.tools/dappsys/ds-roles.html) for details on how to roles and capabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts.


### Operations Permissions
Function permissions are granted to function signatures and are ```bytes4``` based, note the signature creation from the sample above:
```solidity
bytes4(keccak256("setData(string)"))
```

Operations are `bytes32` hashes that are generated in functions and checked against the authority. As many hashes generated throughout the contract code are ```bytes32``` hashes, operation hashes are combinations of those hashes. For example, the permission hash for adding list entries to the list `sampleList` in a Data Contract is build this way:
```solidity
keccak256(keccak256(keccak256("listentry"), keccak256("sampleList")), keccak256("set"))
```

Looks a bit more confusing than it actually is. If aligned by its hashing steps, it looks like this:
```solidity
keccak256(
  keccak256(
    keccak256("listentry"),
    keccak256("sampleList")
  ),
  keccak256("set")
)
```
So basically, the name `sampleList` is hashed with its type `listentry` and the result is hashed with the operation type `set`.

This hash can then be assigned in the same manner as granting permissions for function hashes:
```solidity
// create hash
bytes32 operation = keccak256(keccak256(keccak256("listentry"), keccak256("sampleList")), keccak256("set"));

// assign the permission to group 0 and address 0
roles.setRoleOperationCapability(0, 0, operation, true);
```

As seen in the example above, permissions are granted to address `0`. An address is passed to the function to keep interface compatibility, but the checks are performed independent from the contract address and a roles authority is created for each contract.

Again, passing ```false``` as the last argument revokes permissions.

See section 'DataContract' for more example of configurable operations.


## Distributed File System Encryption
### Envelopes
As basically all data, which can be described as 'content', are stored via the hybrid storage approach, the main part of data are stored in the distributed file system. These data are encrypted and stored in so called 'envelopes', which are a container for the data itself and contain enough information for the API to determine which key to use for decryption and where to retrieve the key from.

[![envelope](/public/dev/envelope.png){:max-width="50%"}](/public/dev/envelope.png)

This is an example envelope:
```json
{
  "public": {
    "name": "envelope example"
  },
  "private": "...",
  "cryptoInfo": {
    "algorithm": "aes-256-cbc",
    "keyLength": 256,
    "originator": "0xf95c14e6953c95195639e8266ab1a6850864d59a829da9f9b13602ee522f672b",
    "block": 123
  }
}
```

The 'public' section contains data that are visible without being invited or related to the contract. The 'private' section can only be decrypted, if the user trying to read the data has been added to the sharings of the contract. The ```cryptoInfo``` part is used to determine, which decryption algorithm to use and where to look for it.

When decrypted, the ```private``` section takes precedence over the ```public``` section. This can lead to the private section overwriting sections of the ```public``` part. For example, a public title may be replaced with a 'true' title (only visible for members) from the private section.

### Hash Encryption
When envelopes are stored in the distributed file system, they can be retrieved via a hash. It is similar to an address of these data. This hash is then stored in the Smart Contract and contract participants can get the hash from the contract, retrieve the data from the DFS and decrypt it. To prevent data hoarders from pulling hashes from Smart Contracts, storing the DFS files for them and brute forcing them later on, hashes are encrypted before storing them in the Smart Contract as well.

### Crypto Algorithms
#### aes-256-cbc
The default encryption is AES with cypher block chaining and a key length of 256 bit. This is commonly used for encrypting data in the API.

#### aes-blob
The actual encryption in this mode utilizes 'aes' as well, but the ```private``` part only holds a reference to the encrypted file or files in the distributed file system and the envelope is basically a listing with references to the encrypted files.

#### aes-ecb
This algorithm is used for encrypting file hashes, which are 32 byte values. 'ecb' ensures that encrypted hashes can be saved in the Smart Contract. Keys for hashes are created per contract and all hashes for a contract are encrypted with the same hash.

#### unencrypted
Like the name suggests, this is not an actual encryption. The envelope is just used as a wrapper for unencrypted data that follow the same guidelines. This is useful when the data scheme requires an envelope but the data should be public.
