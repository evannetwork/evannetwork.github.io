# evan governance
[evan.network](https://evan.network/) enables trustful business relationships while maintaining the data sovereignty of the interacting network partners. This trust is based on the decentralized nature of the network, in which no central intermediary has control over data and processes. Decentralization does not mean, however, that the network is without control and supervision.

Therefore, it is important to establish an organizational structure through which the network is managed efficiently and in partnership. For this reason, it is planned to take control over technological decisions that affect the core of the network in a governance structure.

Such decisions include, for example, the implementation of a hardfork, the inclusion of new AuthorityNodes, the use of new technologies or new updates to existing components, or decisions to invest in the expansion of the network.

## The Implementation of the evan governance
At the start of the evan.network productive network, it is planned to bind the [AuthorityNodes](/doc/authoritynode) to the network via a Authority Node Operations Aggreement (ANOA).

The ANOA defines the Service Level Agreements (SLA) that a AuthorityNode must comply with in order to count as an active AuthorityNode and thereby to be allowed to exercise its voting rights in the evan governance.

Any organization that provides services according to the ANOA definitions can become a Authority Node and thus governance member. The goal is that only companies and universities or institutes become governance members, i.e. not natural persons.

In the medium term it is planned to transfer the governance into an own organization (e.g. cooperative or association), so that commercial decisions can also be made from the governance (e.g. the investments in new services provided on evan.network).

In the first phase, the governance is a loose link to all Authority Nodes that can propose changes and enhancements to the network via the Governance Smart Contracts.

## Advantages
With the evan Governance, evan.network has two big benefits:
1. To ensure the highest possible trust, the responsibility for extending and managing the network shall be with the network stakeholders.
2. To ensure the highest possible growth, the network shall be open for all businesses and developers to realize their own decentralized business model.

To make this possible, the legal, technical and organizational evan.network governance structure will be established step by step by evan GmbH.
