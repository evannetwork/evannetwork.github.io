# ENS2DNS

Gives you the possibility to reach every [ENS](/dev/ens) name through a normal [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)<sup>[+]</sup> resolution e.g. from the browser.

If you have registered a ENS name e.g. `4711.digitaltwin.mydomain.evan` and you have provided a [DBCP](/dev/dbcp) spec with a working ÐAPP, than you can access this ÐAPP in the Browser via `https://4711.digitaltwin.mydomain.evan`

The ENS2DNS service is in test currently.
