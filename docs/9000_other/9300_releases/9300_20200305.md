Todays releases mainly focused on bugfixes, feedback from the community and more additional features for the DID and VC Support!

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Highlights in the API
## üìë Precompiled smart-contracts
We removed the precompiled smart contracts in the smart-contracts-core package to ensure that the correct libraries for the different evan.network blockchains (testcore & core) are included in the compiled files. This operation took some time during first start of the api-blockchain-core runtime. When the device was on low power the compilation may have failed because this step could be terminated after 30 seconds.

With the release of version 2.10.0 we now reintroduced precompiled contracts and are now replacing the library addresses for the different networks on the fly. You do not need to update your existing code, it works out of the box. The only thing to consider is, that you now have to define which network you're using with an environment variable called `EVAN_CHAIN`. You can set it to `testcore` and `core` to use these networks. If you not set the environment variable, it fallbacks to the `testcore` network.

This also applies for the browser included smart-contracts. You have to set the variable  `window.process.env.EVAN_CHAIN` to the respective network. When this object not exist, create it before you require the `api-blockchain-core` or the `smart-contracts-core` package.


## üéâ No more smart-contracts-core-browserified
When you are building a web project based on the evan apis, you had to include the *-browserified versions of the smart-contracts package and provide the contracts to the runtime. The field `browser` has been added to the `package.json` of the smart-contracts-core module. This points to the browser compatible version of the smart contracts. Bundlers like Webpack automatically detect this field and include this in the bundled version of the webapp. With this feature you don't have to include the custom browserified version of the smart contracts and you also can remove the import of the smart-contracts-core package, because the api-blockchain-core automatically does this for you.

Before:
```javascript
import * as bcc from '@evan.network/api-blockchain-core-browserified';
import * as smartcontracts from '@evan.network/smart-contracts-core-browserified';

// ... skipped the initialization of the web3

const formattedContracts = {};
Object.keys(smartcontracts).forEach((key) => {
    const contractKey = (key.indexOf(':') !== -1) ? key.split(':')[1] : key;
    formattedContracts[contractKey] = smartcontracts[key];
});

// create runtime
const runtime = await bcc.createDefaultRuntime(web3, dfs, {
  mnemonic: 'aaa bbb ccc',
  password: 'password',
}, {
  contracts: formattedContracts,
});
```

After:
```javascript
import * as bcc from '@evan.network/api-blockchain-core-browserified';

// ... skipped the initialization of the web3

// create runtime
const runtime = await bcc.createDefaultRuntime(web3, dfs, {
  mnemonic: 'aaa bbb ccc',
  password: 'password',
});
```

## üëç More features for DIDs and VCs
To enable more standard W3C properties in the evan DID documents we've added the following properties to DID Documents on evan:

- updated
- created
- proof

example shown in here:

  }
}
```

These properties are automatically added when you update your existing DID Document. All DID Documents are then also having a `proof` in it, which will be implicitly checked when you retrieve a DID Document from another account on evan. The created and updated fields will be initially filled with the current timestamp when you update a DID Document and they're not previously set.

With the new `api-blockchain-core`version 2.18.0 you now have also the possibility to deactivate your DID Document. This functionality is nearly the same as the `revoke` for VCs... only for DIDs. You can use this function on the `did` module on the runtime described in the [docu](https://api-blockchain-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profile/did.html#deactivatediddocument)

```javascript
const twinIdentity = '0x1234512345123451234512345123451234512345';
const twinDid = await runtime.did.convertIdentityToDid(twinIdentity);
await runtime.did.deactivateDidDocument(twinDid);
```

There is also a corresponding function `didIsDeactivated` which checks if the given DID is already deactivated. Function described in the [docu](https://api-blockchain-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profile/did.html#didisdeactivated)

```javascript
const twinIdentity = '0x1234512345123451234512345123451234512345';
const twinDid = await runtime.did.convertIdentityToDid(twinIdentity);
await runtime.did.deactivateDidDocument(twinDid);
console.log(await runtime.did.didIsDeactivated(twinDid));
// Output: true
```


### üèé Improved performance for digital twin sharing
We received a feedback, that when sharing data from digital twin containers it takes a very long time if you want to share more than 1 or 5 fields. We had a look into this and are now executing the transactions for the sharing in parallel and the sharing should now be done (up to 50%) faster.
