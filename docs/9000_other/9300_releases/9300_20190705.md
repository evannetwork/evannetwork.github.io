# Release Notes 05.07.2019

This release focuses the support for the new web3 version 1.0.0-beta.55 which is a complete reimplementation from the new maintainer of web3. The api-blockchain-core and the dbcp package are increased as a bugfix version because they now support both implementation versions of web3 <= beta.37 and >= beta.37. the version >= beta.37 now supports full reconnect handling of the websocket provider (which previously was not implemented)

When you now want to use web3 beta.55 with dbcp and api-blockchain-core you now must initialize web3 the following way:

```javascript
  const provider = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(
    runtimeConfig.web3Provider,
    { clientConfig: { keepalive: true, keepaliveInterval: 5000 } });
  const web3 = new Web3(provider, null, { transactionConfirmationBlocks: 1 });
```

This is also documented in the blockchain core docs: <https://api-blockchain-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#adding-blockchain-core>
