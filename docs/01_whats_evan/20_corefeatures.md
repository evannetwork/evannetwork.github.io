# Core features

#### [Decentralized Identities](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/Identity)

In evan.network everything, no matter if human, machine or organization has a decentralized, self-sovereign identity which enables them to securely and instantaneously interact with each other.

#### [Smart Contract Access Delegation (SCAD)](https://evannetwork.github.io/dev/security)

Smart Contract Access Delegation (SCAD) enables evan.network users to define permissions for smart contracts at a granular level, including complex trans organizational rights and permission management.

#### [Packaged DApps](https://evannetwork.github.io/dapps/basics)

Packaged Distributed Applications (DApps) on the evan.network are designed to ease the development process on the blockchain by automically taking care of all necessary backend components.

#### [Customized Namespaces](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/namespaces)

Evan.network uses a nameservice to provide namespaces for DApps and identities, adding unique names as identifiers for applications or identities.

#### [Secure IoT connectivity](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/iotsecurity)

In order to adequately cover all security aspects without the need for any extra service implementation, the secure IoT connectivity feature of evan.network offers a functioning IoT security suite for enterprises.

#### [Contract Templates](https://evannetwork.github.io/dev/deployment)

Contract templates are a great way to bootstrap smart contract development and adapt contracts to specific business needs.

#### [Stable Transaction Costs](/doc/eve)
Transaction costs have been a significant cause for concern in the past. Unforeseeable price changes provide no basis for any business to operate with and have deterred many ventures into blockchain projects.
