# Angular - Task ƉApp Custom Contract
**Before performing this example, please go through the [Task ƉApp setup](/docs/developers/ui/angular/task.html) tutorial, as this tutorial is based on this example.**

In this section, you will create contracts, read from them and handle several data interactions with the contract by using the evan.network DataContract and the blockchain-core. So each data that is currently cached within the local storage will be moved into a contract.

For how to write the task ƉApp much easier using the evan.network DataContract and the blockchain-core, have a look here : [Angular - Task ƉApp Data Contract](/docs/developers/ui/angular/task-custom.html).

If you don't want to code by yourself, you can simply read the docs and copy the final resulting src folder from [dapps/task-custom-contract/src](https://github.com/evannetwork/sample-dapps-angular/tree/master/dapps/task-data-contract) to the [dapps/task/src](https://github.com/evannetwork/sample-dapps-angular/tree/master/dapps/task) folder.
