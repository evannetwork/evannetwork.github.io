# vue.js evan.network

Vue applications using the evan.network framework are build using several Vue and css extensions. Starting using the evan.network generator, a fully working dapp development structure will be created, including webpack build jobs. DApps that will be created in this development kit can be opened within the evan.network [dapp-browser](https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/ui/basics.html).

The following extensions are included:
  - JS extensions
    - [dexiejs](https://dexie.org/)
    - [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/)
  - Vue Extensions
    - [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
    - [i18n vuex](https://github.com/dkfbasel/vuex-i18n)
    - [leaflet](https://github.com/KoRiGaN/Vue2Leaflet)
    - [moment](https://github.com/brockpetrie/vue-moment)
    - [recaptcha](https://github.com/DanSnow/vue-recaptcha)
    - [router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
    - [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
  - CSS
    - [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
    - [material icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

## Kick start
1. install the evan.network generator
```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-evan
```

2. generate your new project
```
mkdir vuetest
cd vuetest
yo evan
```

3. add your vue application (don't forget to select the correct dapp type)
```
yo evan:dapp
```

4. open 2 terminals and run the following scripts
```
npm run serve
```
```
npm run dapps-build
npm run dapps-serve
```

5. Open http://localhost:3000/dev.html#/vuetest.evan

## Project Structure
Looking at the root project structure, you will find the `gulp`, `scripts` and `vue` folder. In this folders all the build jobs are included. The most important one for the vue development, is the `webpack.config.js`, included within the vue file. During the build of a DApp, it's webpack file will back reference to this file. As a result of this, all dapps can be build with one maintained webpack file.

Within the dapps folder you will find all DApps that are included in your project. With the commands `npm run dapps-build` and `npm run dapps-serve` you can build dapps and watch file changes for rebuilding. The base definition of the DApp is included within the `dbcp.json`. Within this file you can specify all dependencies that should be loaded by the `dapp-browser`. Per default, the `evancore.vue.libs` (`@evan.network/@evan.network/ui-vue-core`) library is loaded, the heart of the evan.network vue framework. it includes all vue and css extensions and functions that are needed to run vue projects easily. For a list, which libraries are available using ens addresses within the evan.network, have a look at the [API ui documentation](https://ui-docs.readthedocs.io/core/index.html) and the [API vue documentation](https://ui-docs.readthedocs.io/vue/index.html). But you can simply include your own libraries into your dapps, or you can create your own library dapp containers by yourself ([sample](https://github.com/evannetwork/ui-vue/tree/master/dapps/vue.libs)).

## Vue structure
All generate vue dapps are writte in typescript. The `index.ts` starts the full application using a simple function that is included within the `@evan.network/ui-vue-core`. In this function all configurations can be passed simply, like components, routes, dbcpName, Vue class, container, ... .

```
export async function startDApp(container: any, dbcpName: any, dappEnsOrContract: any, dappBaseUrl: any) {
  await initializeVue({
    components,
    container,
    dappBaseUrl,
    dappEnsOrContract,
    dbcpName,
    RootComponent,
    routes,
    state: { },
    translations,
    Vue,
  });
}
```

The routing is defined within the `routes.ts`.
