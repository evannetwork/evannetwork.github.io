# Workshop - HEM

A good starting point for how to interact with evan.network is our [Heavy Machines Workshop](https://github.com/evannetwork/workshop-hem/wiki). This workshop covers the following points:

- how smart contract can be created in an application
- how they can be extended and updated
- how access to data in it can be granted to other accounts
- how an IoT device can be attached
