# ENS

ENS is the [Ethereum Name Service](https://github.com/ethereum/ens)<sup>[+]</sup> adapted to the need of evan.network. Normally a contract has a 32 byte hex id e.g. `0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d`, the work with such ids is not very convenient for users, especially if your system is based on ÐAPPs where everything is a contract.

The ENS allows developers to give real/speaking names to contract ids like DNS does for IP Adresses in the Web.

The top level domain (TLD) for every name you can register is fixed to `.evan`

You can register custom ENS domainnames for your company or application and can register custom subdomains below your domain. We offer an ENS ÐAPP to register custom domains later, in the meantime you can contact the developer on [Gitter ENS](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/ens)<sup>[+]</sup>.

**NOTE:** All names you have registered in the public Ethereum Blockchain are not available in evan.network.
