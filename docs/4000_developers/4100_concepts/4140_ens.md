# ENS

ENS is the [Ethereum Name Service](https://github.com/ethereum/ens) adapted to the need of evan.network. Normally a contract has a 32 byte hex id e.g. `0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d`, working with such ids is not very convenient for users, especially if your system is based on ÐApps in which case you might want to host your ÐApp data in a location that is easily accessable by your users.

The ENS allows developers to give real/speaking names to contract ids like DNS does for IP Adresses in the Web.

The top level domain (TLD) for every name you can register is fixed to `.evan`

You can register custom ENS domainnames for your company or application and can register custom subdomains below your domain. We offer an ENS ÐApp to register custom domains later, in the meantime you can contact the developer on [Gitter ENS](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/ens).

TODO: ENS explanation
  - short explanation about lifetime, pricing
  - reference to management DApp (4545_ens-purchase.2do)
-->

**NOTE:** The public Ethereum blockchain and evan.network are separate networks, so ENS addresses you bought on Ethereum cannot be used on evan.network and vice versa. If they are not yet claimed, you can purchase those on evan.network with the ENS purchase ÐApp. <!-- TODO: link -->  To avoid confusion about this topic, evan.network uses the TLD domain `.evan` (in comparison to the default TLD domain `.eth` on Ethereum)
