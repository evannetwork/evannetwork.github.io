## Scalability
A big challenge to blockchain technology is the number of possible parallel transactions.

There is still no final solution for realistically achieving almost infinite scalability within a blockchain. To counter this fact the evan.network is structured in such a way that the organization and technology of the AuthorityNodes make it possible to launch specialized or use case specific SideChains at any time.

These are also subject to DAO governance but, depending on your setup, configuration and rules, allow you to perform specified use cases in much higher volumes.

The technologies and services used in evan.network such as the name service or DBCP descriptions make it easier for users and developers to interact seamlessly with their contracts and √êApps regardless of this technical separation.
