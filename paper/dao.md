# DAO
**Evan.network** enables trustful business relationships while maintaining the data sovereignty of the interacting network partners. This trust is based on the decentralized nature of the network, in which no central intermediary has control over the data and processes. Decentralization does not mean, however, that the network is without control and supervision.

Therefore it is important to establish an organisational structure through which the network is managed efficiently and in partnership. For this reason, it is planned to take control over technological decisions that affect the core of the network in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Such decisions include, for example, the implementation of a hard-fork, the inclusion of new master nodes, the use of new technologies or new updates to existing components, or decisions to invest in the expansion of the network. 

## The Implementation of the DAO
At the start of the evan.network productive network it is planned to bind the [MasterNodes](/doc/masternode) to the network via MastnerNode Operations Aggreement (MNOA). The MNOA defines the Service Level Agreements (SLA) that a MasterNode must comply with in order to count as an active MasterNode and thus exercise its voting rights in the DAO. Any organization that provides services according to the MNOA definitions can become MasterNode and thus DAO member. The goal is that only companies and universities or institutes become DAO members, i.e. not natural persons. In the medium term it is planned to transfer the DAO into an own organization (e.g. cooperative or association), so that commercial decisions can also be made from the DAO (e.g. the investments in new services provided on evan.network).  
In the first phase, the DAO is a loose link to all MasterNodes that can make changes to the network via [Smart Contracts](/dev/smart-contracts).
