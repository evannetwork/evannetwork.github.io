# Angular - Task DApp Custom Contract
**Before performing this example, please go through the [Task DApp setup](/dapps/angular/task) tutorial, as this tutorial is based on this example.**

In this section you will create contracts, read from them and handle several data interactions with the contract by using the evan.network DataContract and the blockchain-core. So each data that is currently cached within the local storage will be moved into an contract.

For how to write the task dapp much easier using the evan.network Data-Contract and the blockchain-core have a look here : [Angular - Task DApp Data-Contract](/dapps/angular/task-custom).

If you dont want to code by yourself, you can simply read the docs and copy the final resulting src folder from [dapps/task-custom-contract/src](https://github.com/evannetwork/dapps-tutorial-angular/tree/master/dapps/task-data-contract) to the [dapps/task/src](https://github.com/evannetwork/dapps-tutorial-angular/tree/master/dapps/task) folder.
