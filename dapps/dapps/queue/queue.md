# Queue DApp

The queue DApp is the management point of the general data storage logic. Each DApp uses queues to
store data asynchronously, listen for updates and persist statuses of different storage steps. This
creates a non-blocking and stateful application.

Within the queue DApp, you can view several task that are running. You also can stop and delete
broken or unwanted jobs.

the "synchronization details" button at the bottom of the screen.
