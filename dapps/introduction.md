# Writing ÐApps
This tutorial will show, how to setup an application using the contractus blockchain and ÐApp framework.
By creating an simple application to create, view and share tasks, you will learn to handle full blown
ÐApps including the "decentralized backend and frontend". You will use the following technologies.
  - Ethereum Blockchain, Solidity
  - DBCP
  - SystemJS, Angular 5 & Ionic 3, SASS, Browserify

You will be guided through the following steps:
  - [ÐApp basics](/dapps/basics.md)
  - [build an "Hello World" ÐApp](/dapps/hello-world.md)
  - [create and read a new task (using the generalized contractus Data-Contract)](/dapps/task.md)
  - [finalize using an Taskboard](/dapps/taskboard.md)

When you start to build your own application: 
  - [planning the ÐApp structure](/dapps/planning.md)
  - [best practices](/dapps/advanced.md)

Well, good luck and get started [here](/dapps/basics.md).
