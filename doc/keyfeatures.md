# Key Platform Features

Key Features evan.network
======

### Decentralized Identities

In evan.network everything, no matter if human, machine or organization has a decentralized, self-sovereign identity which enables them to interact with each other in a trustful way.

Identities can be verified using the Identity Verification Service which manages claims provided for every existing identity. With this identities can be checked and gain trust explicitly from trustees or implicit from previous business relations.     


With on-behalf-of logic, accounts can interact with a smart contract in the name of another account. Business scenarios where employees act in the name of a company can be modeled securely in blockchain technology. 

By knowing whom you are dealing with, you are saving time and resources on otherwise costly due diligence processes. The evan.network decentralized identities feature ensures that fraudulent schemes, such as identity theft and impersonation, are a thing of the past.

### On Chain Messaging

Secure, swift and reliable communication with business partners or customers is always critical. 

On evan.network, the platform provides you with the necessary tools in the form of an on-chain AddressBook and a mailbox, adding an extra layer of security by blockchain’s built-in encryption. 

To interact with other users, the on-chain AddressBook allows for a simple key exchange with other users. 


A blockchain based Mailbox simplifies communication with other Identities, like for instance contract invitations.

### Role Based Smart Contract Access Control 

Role-based Smart Contract Access Control with on Chain key exchange grants you the ability to delegate permissions on a granular level.
As with traditional role-based access control, the permission management can be used to facilitate smart contract security administration in organizations of any size with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. 
Permissions can easily be granted across companies, eliminating the need for a complex setup if you want to reliably grant specific permission on specific documents to employees of third companies.
Allow access to those that require it and restrict access from unwanted eyes.

### Packaged DApps 

Packaged Distributed Applications (DApps) on the evan.network are designed to make an entry into the Blockchain sphere as straightforward as possible. 

Making use of the unique packaged DApps service, Distributed Applications will be loaded with all necessary components by default.  

Users of your DApp will automatically have the appropriate UI loaded, and your developers can access APIs and data descriptions in one go.  Practically this means you can start your work on all things DApp within a heartbeat!

On a technical level, this is done by having DApps on the evan.network stored directly on a distributed file system. All DApps are therefore natively hosted from the get-go, eliminating the additional cost for external servers to host your application. 

Using the evan.network framework, Packaged DApps don't have to initialize either the blockchain-core nor any other dependencies, you are saving time and resources by not having to do the footwork on your own.

### Customized Namespaces

Evan.network uses a nameservice to provide unique namespaces for DApps and identitiesand provides unique names for applications or identities. 

Just as with normal URLs your DApps are reachable from the WWW without any additional tools needed.
You don’t need to get used to complex new addresses, such as ‘0x2910543' when you want to call an application.
Instead, you can rely on a classical domain name system.

The namespaces on evan.network lay on top of the ENS, the Ethereum Name System. The ENS is built on smart contracts, removing all the insecurities of the normal DNS system.  

On a technical level that means for you that your security is going to be improved by an additional built-in platform layer, as DNS hijacking is a concern of the past – domain names will always work as they are intended to. This fact eliminates even one of the most subtle of all hijacking techniques.

### Platform IoT Security

In the age of interconnectivity in which not only people but thousands of devices, small to large, are always connected and communicate with each other, security becomes ever more critical. 
To avoid coming up with or implementing secure measures on your own, you can rely on the secure IoT connectivity aspect of evan.network. 
Built-in IoT security is a crucial feature of the platform's holistic approach.

As an example of how this is done, let’s take a look at how on a technical level, you would unlock your car that is part of the evan.network:

When you hit the unlock button on your remote, the signal is processed by a masternode. The masternode is the endpoint receiving the request to unlock your car. Once the masternode verifies that it is you, it will allow for the vehicle to be opened.

However, it could be the case that someone might attempt to compromise a masternode they have control over and tries to open your car without your consent. 

Hence, evan.network has redundancy in the shape of masternodes in place to prevent a takeover or malicious access to your devices at all points.

### Contract templates for rapid development

Contract templates are essential to make any venture into blockchain a successful undertaking.

Designed to enable rapid and cost-effective deployment of smart contracts, you are saving yourself the hassle of having to start from nothing. 
As with any other template, you may adjust existing contracts to tailor them to your specific case.  
Also, predefined smart contracts allow for faster learning and testing of smart contract concepts.
