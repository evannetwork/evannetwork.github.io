# EVE - Token

EVE tokens are the evan.network build in coins to pay transaction fees. EVE is a utility token that can only be used inside the evan.network to pay for the technical infrastructure. EVE Tokens will not be traded on public coin exchanges.

## Production Tokens
The **core** production chain will be launched soon where we also offer a service to buy EVE tokens directly.

## Development Tokens
You can get development tokens for the **testcore** chain for **FREE** through the evan.network [Gitter faucet](https://gitter.im/evannetwork/faucet)<sup>[+]</sup> channel. These EVE tokens only exists in the **testcore** chain and can't be moved to the **core** chain.
