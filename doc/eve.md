# EVE Token

Transaction costs have been a significant cause for concern in the past.
Unforeseeable price changes provide no basis for any business to operate with and have deterred many ventures into blockchain projects.

Hence, evan.network ensures stable transaction costs by issuing the EVE token. 
The EVE token serves as the network's currency and is pegged 1:1 with the Euro.
Tokens can be acquired by exchanging Ethereum(ETH) to EVE.

For every transaction you conduct, you spend a certain amount of EVE tokens. 
Fetching data does not consume any tokens, merely the creation of new assets and uploads to the network consume tokens.
