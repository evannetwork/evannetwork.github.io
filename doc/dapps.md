# DApps Version Control

DApps are directly on a distributed file system and referenced on the smart contract itself, so no need of external application servers to host your application.

Every smart contract describes its API and stored data schema itself. No manual exchange of programming interfaces or data structures is needed. This gives you and your partners always up-to-date metadata of the contract
The Decentralized Business Communication Protocol (DBCP) is used to formalize the interaction with Ethereum based smart contracts. 
Since DBCP descriptions are directly stored on the smart contract, it is possible to integrate existing applications with your Blockchain environment or have them run independently as stand-alone applications.

Utilizing the DBCP protocol you can avoid having to rewrite applications from scratch.
