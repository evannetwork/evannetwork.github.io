# Decentralized Identities

In evan.network everything, no matter if human, machine or organization has a decentralized, self-sovereign identity which enables them to interact with each other in a swift and trusted way.

Identities are stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring that each identity is tamper-proof and canâ€™t be impersonated by,for example, providing fraudulent documentation. Decentralized Identities are a critical feature to evan.network, as they constitute a pivotal point for safe business conduct on the platform. 

Similar to a fingerprint, an identity serves as a unique identifier. 
Their authenticity [can be verified without a doubt](/dev/identity-claims), eliminating the risk of impersonation attacks. 

### Establishing trust relationships

Trust can be established in two ways: **Explicit** or **Implicit**. 

* Explicit trust is established by directly verifying your partner's identity. The relationship is established manually with your contacts through the [AddressBook](/doc/contacts).

* Implicit trust is established automatically. 
Implicit trust functions in the way that identities, with which you have not established an explicit trust relationship, can be trusted indirectly and automatically.

When a  trusted partner of yours has previously established trust with a third-party unknown to you, conducting business from your side with that third party is based on implicit trust. 

This feature is crucial in supply chain scenarios, where you might not or must not know all members of an n-tier supply chain. With implicit trust, secure and seamless transactions, including unknown or anonymous partners, is a non-issue and requires no further manual action, allowing for the construction of various trust models to address specific concerns. 


### On-Behalf Logic

With on-behalf-of logic, accounts can interact with a smart contract in the name of another account. Business scenarios where employees act in the name of a company can be modeled securely in blockchain.

Through on-behalf logic it is possible to realize complex scenarios. You can choose either individual accounts, or a group of accounts, and delegate authority to act on your behalf.

Organizational structures, such as teams in which certain members have certain tasks and responsibilities, can be modeled with simplicity on the blockchain.

By knowing whom you are dealing with, you are saving time and resources on otherwise costly due diligence processes. The evan.network decentralized identities feature ensures that fraudulent schemes, such as identity theft and impersonation, are a thing of the past.
