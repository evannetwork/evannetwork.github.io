# Decentralized Identities

In evan.network everything, no matter if human, machine or organization has a decentralized, self-sovereign identity which enables them to interact with each other in a trustful way.

Identities are stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring that each identity is tamper-proof and canâ€™t be impersonated by for example providing fraudulent documentation. Decentralized identities are a critical feature to evan.network, as they constitute a pivotal point for safe business conduct on the platform. 

Identities can be verified using the Identity Verification Service which manages claims provided for every existing identity. With this identities can be checked and gain trust explicitly from trustees or implicit from previous business relations.     
Explicit trust is given by directly verifying the respective identities authenticity. 

Implicit trust functions in the way that identities, with which you have not established an explicit trust relationship, can be trusted through partners. When an existing trusted partner of yours trusts a third-party unknown to you, conducting business with that third party is based on implicit trust. 
This feature is crucial in supply chain scenarios, where you might not or must not know all members of an n-tier supply chain. Utilizing implicit trust, secure and seamless transactions even with unknown and anonymous partners is a non-issue anc requires no further, allowing for the construction of various trust models to address specific concerns, e.g. data privacy within a supply chain.

With on-behalf-of logic, accounts can interact with a smart contract in the name of another account. Business scenarios where employees act in the name of a company can be modeled securely in blockchain technology. Utilizing on-behalf logic it is possible to realize complex scenarios, in which you choose either individual accounts or a group of accounts and define permissions on a granular level for specific smart contracts. Organizational structures, such as teams in which certain members have certain tasks and responsibilities, can be modeled with simplicity on the blockchain.

By knowing whom you are dealing with, you are saving time and resources on otherwise costly due diligence processes. The evan.network decentralized identities feature ensures that fraudulent schemes, such as identity theft and impersonation, are a thing of the past.
