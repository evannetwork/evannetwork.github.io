# Namespaces

Evan.network uses a nameservice to provide unique namespaces for DApps and identities and provides unique names for applications or identities. 

Just as with normal URLs your DApps are reachable from the WWW without any additional tools needed.
You don’t need to get used to complex new addresses, such as ‘0x2910543' when you want to call an application.
Instead, you can rely on a classical domain name system.

The namespaces on evan.network lay on top of the ENS, the Ethereum Name System. The ENS is built on smart contracts, removing all the insecurities of the normal DNS system.  

On a technical level that means for you that your security is going to be improved by an additional built-in platform layer, as DNS hijacking is a concern of the past – domain names will always work as they are intended to. This fact eliminates even one of the most subtle of all hijacking techniques.
