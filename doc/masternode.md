# MasterNode


The evan.network MasterNode is a node that can legitimize new transactions in the network. This node retrieves sent transactions to the network and signs them into new blocks. Thus, the MasterNode contributes to the decentralization of the network. To guarantee security, this node has no opened ports to any RPC or Websocket API. It only signs transactions and seal blocks. The evan.network MasterNode operator provides several servers. The servers need to be hosted in a European data center.
