**Development Plan related questions of evan.network**

#### Q.
***What’s the vision of evan.network?***

#### A.
evan.network is the B2B cooperation network with European trust.

In an increasingly networked world, the pressure of competition is becoming harder and globalized. To be competitive, every company needs to focus on it’s own core- competency and to work in a dynamic network of partner organizations for offering exciting services to their customer all over the world. Rigid supply chains must become flexible value networks. The evan.network is a global, decentralized enterprise network based on Blockchain technology. It is organized and operated by trustful European companies. Based on the evan.network, all companies or organizations can realize their decentralized use cases.

#### Q.
***What are the benefits of evan.network?***

#### A.
The benefits are:
* **Public.** The evan.network can be used for collaboration by any user. It is publicly available and usable.

* **Performance.** Fast block times with about four seconds and more than a hundred transactions per second can be executed within the network.

* **Independence.** [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode) come from different industries and do not affect the collaboration of users within the Business Center. The sovereignty over data and applications lies always with the users or the Business Center Ownern.

* **Security and trust.** The network is operated decentralized. Only the [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode) are allowed to sign blocks in the network. In case of violations [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode) can be excluded.

* **Energy efficient operation.** There is no energy wasting while mining (only the known [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode) sign blocks with proof of authority, no proof of work).

* **Transparency.** Changes to the blockchain such as Hardforks can only be performed by the [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode), so trust is not tied to a single organization.

* **Expandability.** Ethereum-based smart contracts can be created and used by users.
