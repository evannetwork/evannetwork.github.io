## How the evan.network works
The evan.network is an open ecosystem, providing companies in almost every industry the ability to build individual digital business models based on blockchain technology. It paves the way for future-orientated business models in which the sovereignty over data and the flexible cooperation between partners are crucial to success. At its core, evan.network is a counterweight to the currently dominating central marketplaces.


The evan.network is an Ethereum-based enterprise blockchain operated by evan.network partners. Organizations can take advantage of decentralized collaboration without having to understand the complexity of blockchain technology. Thus, blockchain solutions can be used in daily business.

In general, the evan.network combines the advantages of both public and  private blockchains.
The evan.network architecture provides organizations the ability to build individual business
models in a truly decentralized network, without the drawbacks of a public blockchain
solution. Building your own business model on the evan.network can help you encourage:
* new cooperative business models
* efficient cooperation among partners

The evan.network consists of different components, which are short presented below.

### 1. Specific Sub Networks
Based on the ecosystem of the evan.network almost everyone can build their own specific sub networks in all industries where cooperation with partners is important. The organizations or associations bekome the role of a business center owner. But nobody in the business center has access to the transaction data. Data from a business relationship is exchanged directly between the partner via smart contracts and written to the blockchain by the decentralized [MasterNodes](/doc/masternode). The business center owner therefore only provides the functional basis for the cooperation. The cooperation takes place without his intervention.
### 2. [Services](/doc/services)
With ready to use enterprise services, such as digital twin contracts or secure data exchange, the evan.network makes blockchain ready for every business.
### 3. Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](/doc/dao))
The evan.network will be operated as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](/doc/dao)) that is run through rules, encoded as smart contracts, determined by the operators of the MasterNodes.
### 4. [MasterNodes](/doc/masternode) operators
Independent [MasterNodes](/doc/masternode), operated by credible European organizations, ensure a secure, reliable and sustainable high-performance Blockchain for trustworthy B2B-Transactions.
