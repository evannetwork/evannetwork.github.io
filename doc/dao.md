# DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization

In [evan.network](https://evan.network/), trusting business relationships are made possible. The interacting network partners nevertheless retain their data sovereignty. This trust is based on the decentralization of the network. No central intermediary has control over the data and processes. But decentralization does not mean that the network is without control.

*A decentralized network of trust must be operated decentrally.*

Therefore, it is important to establish an organizational structure which leads the network democratically and efficiently. So the evan.network will be operated as a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** that is run through rules, encoded as smart contracts, determined by the operators of the [MasterNodes](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/masternode).
The DAO makes democratic decisions about the network. For example such decisions are the inclusion of new MasterNodes or decisions to invest in the expansion of the network.
By establishing a DAO, it is possible that decisions in the evan.network are not performed by a single organization or user. The network gains stability and trust through the democratic approach.

With the DAO the evan.network has two big benefits:
1. To ensure the most possible trust, the responsibility for extending and managing the network shall be with the network stakeholders.
2. To ensure the highest possible growth, the network shall be open for all businesses and developers to realize their own decentralized business model.

To make this possible, the legal, technical and organizational evan.network DAO structure will be established step by step by contractus GmbH, using the [token](https://evannetwork.github.io/doc/eve) sale funding.
