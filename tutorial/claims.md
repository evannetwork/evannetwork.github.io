# Claims

The general Claims DApp allows you, to check the validity of claims of an special identity every time in an detailed overview. You can also issue, decline and accept new claims. If you haven't an identity management service yet, the UI will ask you to create one.

Insert a claim path and an user for that you want to check the claim. If the claim isn't issued yet, you can issue the claim to the selected account.
