# Dashboard
The dashboard ÐAPP is your main entry point when logging in into evan.network.

When this is your first login, there isn't much to see yet. The most interesting part should be the "My Profile" section.

Depending on how you were invited, you will have different starting balances.

But your profile name and accountID are there to check and copy.

As is the private key, in case you ever have to import it somewhere, to a different workstation for example.

The profile encryption key isn't immediately obvious probably, but it is the key used to encrypt all the important data in your blockchain profile. It really shouldn't be the same as your private key.

Here you can use or manage your bookmarked ÐAPPs. When adding bookmarks, you can add ENS addresses, contract addresses or select featured ÐAPPs. Added bookmarks are stored in your profile.

Can you see the featured Taskboard bookmark in the "+ Add Bookmark" section? Add it to your personal bookmarks for easier access.
