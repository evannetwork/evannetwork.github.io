# First Steps

In this chapter we would like to show you how easy it is to go the first steps in the evan.network.

Lets consider our Taskboard √êapp, a simple ToDo List Manager for teams.

The first thing you need is of course user accounts, so you have someone you can assign tasks to.
Someone's gotta do the work.

So let's do that:  

## [Create an Identity](/tutorial/create-identity)

Here we have the first big difference to any classical multi-user system: there is no central place
where user credentials are stored. An account is just a private key, and each user has full control over
where it is stored. It usually never leaves the computer you are sitting in front of. As does the password, it's never transmitted over the network. If you do want to use your account from a different machine, you have to explicitely import it.

So, while your credentials are private and local, and under your full control, the profile data associated with it is global, equally accessible from anywhere, stored on potentially any and every machine participating in the evan.network, impossible to delete as long as there is at least one client left.

This is what we call the smart-contract. Why smart? Because although it is stored "everywhere", you can only do anything with it, if you have the credentials. The access happens through a strictly defined interface. If you don't want anyone else to read your data, you store it encrypted. If you want to freely share it, you store it plain. Either way, only yourself and the people you have authorized to do so can change anything. No one exclusively holds and controls the data, no one can read it, unless you allow them to.

## [Let's have a Look at your Profile and Data](/tutorial/dashboard)
You most likely are logged in already, aren't you?

Have you added the Taskboard Bookmark? It is a smart contract, a data contract of its own btw.

Unlike the bookmark links you store in the browser, this isn't stored just on your one browser installation. And unlike the synced bookmarks in your Apple account for example, this isn't stored in a data center controlled by Apple, that they can data-mine, or that even might go down or expire when you stop paying your fees. Those are stored in the blockchain. Available from anywhere, as long as the network exists.

## [Finally the Taskboard](/tutorial/taskboard)

While working with tasks you will come accross the requirement of coordinating with others.
And for that you need contacts:

## [Who do I work with? The Contacts](/tutorial/contacts)

You can add anyone in evan.network to your contacts.  
And you can invite anyone with an email address into evan.network to become your contact.

They all have or will get a profile smart contract, just like you.

## [Talking to Each Other: The Mailbox](/tutorial/mailbox)

We call the messages sent and stored in evan.network Bmails, equivalent to Emails. And the communication
style is similar to Emails, in that it doesn't really lend itself to instant messaging and chatting due to the blochain transaction delays.

There is one major difference to Emails though: you always have a sender, and the sender can't be forged, and every BMail costs EVEs. So spam cannot really exist. Whenever anyone sends spam, it will cost him a lot, and he is instantly identfied and can be permanently blocked.
