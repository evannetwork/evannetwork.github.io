# Contacts
The contacts √êAPP is your address book, where you can manage contacts from the blockchain.

## Adding new Contacts
Adding new contacts initiates a key exchange process with the person you want to add, which will, if completed, allow you to exchange blockchain mails (or "bmails") with this person.

When you add new contacts you can choose whether you want to add the contact via account id or via email address.

If adding accounts via account id, a key exchange with this person will be triggered and the invitee will receive a bmail with your contact request.

If adding accounts via email, you are required to provide a small amount of onboarding EVEs for the invitee. The invitee will receive an email with your onboarding invitation and a link to create or import a profile and then claim the provided onboarding EVE.

Inviting users via email requires you to have added the onboarding [Smart Agent](/dev/smart-agents) to your contacts. If you haven't already added the agent to your contacts, a request for this is displayed when clicking on the "Using an E-Mail" button.

Confirming this request will perform a key exchange with the smart agent to enable you to send encrypted messages with the smart agent, which is required to invite new users via email.


## Managing Contacts
You can rename or delete contacts from your address book by clicking on them.

The second tab, "contact status" lets you review your contact request status, which allows you to check if an invitee already has replied to your contact request.
